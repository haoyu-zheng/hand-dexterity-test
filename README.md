# hand-dexterity-test
An experimental analysis method for measuring the dexterity of primate hand movements. In experiments, primates grasp 6mm square diced apples from a 1cm slit. High speed cameras are used to record the kinematic parameters during this process.
The experiment is based on the experimental method used in doi: 10.1152/jn.00342.2004 and doi: 10.1126/science.1147243.

-version 1.0
The number of experiments, duration of experiments and two types of errors defined in doi: 10.1038/nature11206 can be accurately identified.
